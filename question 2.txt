Undefined

1)Whenever we declare a variable without assigning any value to it, javascript implicitly assigns its value as 
undefined.

  let name;
  console.log(name); //undefined
  
2) When value is not assigned in array or object

  let numArray = [1,2,,4];
  console.log(numArray);  
  //[1, 2, empty, 4]
  typeof(numArray[2])
  //"undefined"
  
3) When functions don’t have a return statement but are called for assigning a value to a variable.

  let add = (a,b) => {
  let c = a+b;
  //return c;
  }
  let sum = add(2,3);
  console.log(sum); 



Not defined

A not defined is a variable which is not declared at a given point of time with declaration keyword like var, 
let or const.

  console.log(a);
  var a = 5;

While if we don’t use var keyword above the output will be:-

  console.log(b);
  b = 5;
  //Output:- "ReferenceError: b is not defined
  
The reason why the variable a was printed with undefined value above but b was declared as not defined was 
because of the way variable hoisting works in javascript i.e. 
the variable declarations are processed before code execution takes place in javascript.

Internally the execution for the variable a above was as follows:-

  var a;
  console.log(a); //undefined
  a = 5;
  
While for variable b above it was as follows:-

  console.log(b); // b is not defined
  window.b = 5;
