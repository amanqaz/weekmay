var is the variable can initislied as many time as we want
   var tester = "hey hi";
    
    function newFunction() {
        var hello = "hello";
    }
    console.log(hello);


let is variable is initilsied once and then we only update value of it
   let greeting = "say Hi";
   let times = 4;

   if (times > 3) {
        let hello = "say Hello instead";
        console.log(hello);// "say Hello instead"
    }
   console.log(hello) // hello is not defined



const 
Variables declared with the const maintain constant values

 const greeting = "say Hi";
